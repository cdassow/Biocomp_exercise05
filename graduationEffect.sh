#For Exercise 05 Assignment 3. This script determines the effect of graduating college on the minimum wage for earners in the wages.csv dataset
#USAGE: 

#cp columns 3 and 4, separate high school graduates (3rd column, 12=<16) and college graduates (3rd column, 16=<) into separate csv files maybe outside the script
#take average of 4th column for hs and college
#subtract college_avg_wage - hs_avg_wage = final answer
